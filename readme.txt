== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What's the difference between the **MyFatoorah - Cards** and **MyFatoorah - Embedded** payment methods? =
* **MyFatoorah - Cards**: This uses the default gateways that were enabled in your portal account. You should enable only this payment method. 
* **MyFatoorah - Embedded**: This is used only if you have any gateway that has the direct payment feature in it at your portal account.

= What is the difference between the List Payment Options? = 
* **MyFatoorah Invoice Page (Redirect):** It will redirect the buyer to the MyFatoorah invoice page that contains a list of all payment gateways with their service charges.
* **List All Enabled Gateways in Checkout Page:** It will list the payment gateways inside your website and then will redirect the buyer straightway to the payment gateway page.

= What is the Single Gateway View? = 
Select this option if you enabled only one gateway in your MyFatoorah portal account, and you need to display a custom title/icon instead of the default title/icon.

= What is the Webhook Secret Key? = 
This option enables triggering events each time the order status changes at the MyFatoorah portal side. This feature recovers the lost orders due to connection loss or delay called back. Kindly refer to the https://myfatoorah.readme.io/docs/woocommerce-webhook.
